# Welcome
My name is Kitty. I'm currently a student with AWS re/Start learning Cloud Computing. I'm also a former IT administrator, ITIL certified, first line help desk support and freelance copy editor.

## AWS Re/Start
I've been so happy to study Cloud Computing with AWS. It's really comprehensive and so far I've learned and experienced a lot of different technologies. I had a background in IT but this has let me get into the minutiae of how systems work. Some are systems I've worked with for years that I now understand more fully.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Kit-tea/kit-tea.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Kit-tea/kit-tea.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
