# Welcome
My name is Kitty. I'm currently a student with AWS re/Start learning Cloud Computing. I'm also a former IT administrator, ITIL certified, first line help desk support and freelance copy editor.

## AWS Re/Start
I've been so happy to study Cloud Computing with AWS. It's really comprehensive and so far I've learned and experienced a lot of different technologies. I had a background in IT but this has let me get into the minutiae of how systems work. Some are systems I've worked with for years that I now understand more fully.

### Linux
The Bash challenge: Automatically generating twenty five numbered files. We learned all the details of the distros and I created and modified the directories and containing files.

The code itself was simple.

```
#!/bin/bash

#creating 25 empty files with naming convention [name]1 [name]2 [name]3 and so on

touch Kitty{1..25}.txt
```

Originally the brief said that each time we run the script it should automatically create the next 25 files in sequence so I've been working on that as a side project.
